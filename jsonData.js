The new AI tools that Adobe showcased during the three-day-long conference, which ended on Thursday in Los Angeles, made headlines for being transformative, but many also questioned the pitfalls associated with Gen AI technology.The iPhone moment, in hindsight, was massively transformative to our society in both good and bad ways. We’re still trying to figure out the right way to adopt mobile technology, internet technology, cloud technology, and every one of those waves of innovation and disruption. Gen AI will have as big an impact, but I think we will also continue to wrestle with all the questions about how we want to adopt this,” said Ely Greenfield, CTO of Digital Media at Adobe, in an interview with indianexpress.com.",

This contradicts some earlier rumours that suggested Apple could announce new Macs with the M3 chip as soon as this year.The report, which is based on a five-year global notebook shipments forecast, predicts that the notebook market will rebound in 2024 with a 4.7% shipment growth, driven by the easing of inflation and the introduction of new products, including new MacBooks with 3nm-based chips.

It is known for its ability to dissolve in water, forming a gel-like substance that helps soften stools and regulate bowel movements. Additionally, soluble fibre serves as a prebiotic, providing nourishment for beneficial gut bacteria. Including foods rich in soluble fibre in your diet can contribute to a healthier digestive system. But, with due to a busy and spoiled lifestyle, there are several health-related problems that start happening from an early age. People of every age group, from children to the elderly, are struggling with serious diseases like obesity and diabetes, which start with stomach problems. Here are 6 foods that can help with digestion and are known to be rich in soluble fibre. But, before that, here is what soluble fibre can do to your body. Soluble fibre dissolves easily in water, after which it turns into a gel. Its digestion speed is slow, due to which it takes more time to reach the small intestine. This is why, when you eat food rich in soluble fibre, you tend to feel full for a long time and will not feel hungry again and again. The biggest advantage of taking food rich in soluble fibre is that after eating it, you will not have the craving to eat something again and again, due to which your diet will remain under control. Diabetic patients are also advised to take a diet rich in soluble fibre because it does not increase the blood sugar level of the patient rapidly. If you are overweight and are trying hard to reduce it, then include foods with soluble fibre in your diet. This will reduce your appetite and the journey of weight loss will become easier.",

Here is all you need to know about soaking nuts and how it impacts the taste and texture of some common nuts. Anti-nutrients, such as phytic acid, can interfere with the body's ability to absorb essential minerals like calcium, magnesium, and iron. Soaking nuts can help reduce the anti-nutrient content and improve mineral absorption. Soaking nuts can soften their texture and improve their taste. Soaked nuts are often more palatable and can be easier to blend or use in recipes Nuts naturally contain enzyme inhibitors and phytic acid, which can make them harder to digest and may interfere with the absorption of nutrients. Soaking nuts overnight helps to neutralize these compounds, making the nuts easier on the digestive system. ",

It even won the first ever gold for any Indian chocolate bar at the International Chocolate Awards — Asia Pacific 2023 held in Hong Kong in March. The team at the farm-to-bar chocolate brand from Kerala says there is more than just the flavour and aroma that makes the chocolate special. Founder and business head Vikas Temani says the vegan chocolate was crafted with rice milk. Vikas explains, “We didn’t add any tea leaves or tea flavour to the chocolate. Instead, we have used the masalas that go into preparing masala chai, such as ginger, cardamon, and so on. The rice milk is extracted from Japonica rice, a small rice variety that is used in preparing sushi.” The Indian fruits used in Paul and Mike’s other creations include jamun (java plum) and sitaphal (custard apple). Another striking Indian flavour is the thandai-flavoured chocolate. “The brand’s philosophy is to popularise Indian fruits and flavours. The masala chai, however, is not new to the market; we took it to the competition only this year, after working on it for two years with rice milk and tweaking the flavour furthermore,” says Vikas.
